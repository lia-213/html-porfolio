							<h1>About Me</h1>
							<p> Hi, I'm Lydia :) I'm a first year Computer Science student at the University of Edinburgh. I was not exposed to Computer Science as a formal subject until this September when I started my degree. Instead, I came across coding at age 11 via free online courses and fell in love with it, completing small projects as I became more and more exposed to JavaScript, then Python, SQL and HTML/CSS. Later, when I was 16 and 17, I signed up for live courses in Java and React JS, and did some work experience at FIS where I used Python and Visual Basic, gaining further experience across the board development-wise. I also had a chance to work in a team of UX/UI developers at Vodafone....... <!--add more stuff here--> 
								I'm a first year Computer Science student with experience in Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS and Java. When I'm not studying and/or coding, I love playing piano and saxophone, learning languages (Spanish and French), and spending time with friends. I recently travelled to Switzerland to take part in the inaugural Mercuria hackathon, and my team came 2nd! Find out more about that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7010304797320830976/"> here</a>.</p>
